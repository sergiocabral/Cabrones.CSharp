    * Slightly reworked synchronization logic
        1) Significantly reduce thread lock contention in lock manager
           and in SuperServer thread pool manager
        2) Fix rare race condition that could cause SS engine to hang
           during request processing until next request arrival
        3) Make lock manager memory dumps more informative (OWN_hung is detected correctly)
        4) Decouple lock manager synchronization objects for different engine instances
