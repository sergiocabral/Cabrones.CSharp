Winnovative HTML to PDF Converter v7.0 Files

Bin 
---

Contains the HTML to PDF Converter Library assembly (wnvhtmlconvert.dll) that you can use in any type of .NET application
and the XML file to be used by Microsoft Visual Studio IntelliSense for inline help while writing code.

Config
------

Contains configuration files and utilities. IE9Config.exe can be used to resolve some issues that might occur when using the converter 
in ASP.NET applications when IE9 is installed on the machine where the converter runs. If you have troubles running the converter in 
ASP.NET under an IIS pool having an identity which doesn't load the user profile by default (like ApplicationPoolIdentity identity) and 
you have Internet Explorer 9 or later installed on the server you can either set Load User Profile on True in the pool Advanced Settings 
in IIS or you can press the Configure button in the IE9Config utility to get the same effect. After you have set the Load User Profile 
on True or you have pressed the Configure button in the IE9Config utility you have to recycle the IIS pool or restart IIS.
